===========

A very simple word-based URL shortener.  Easy to say, easy to remember, easy
to type.  Visit the base URL `/` and it will suggest a word which you can then
associate with a URL.  If you want to manually choose a word, visit `<word>`
and if not taken, you will be able to fill in its redirection.  All URLs are
for keepsies.
